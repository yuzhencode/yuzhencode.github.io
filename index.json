Therefore, we need to upload the static web files generated by Hugo to the GitHub Pages repository.\n1. Prepare the GitHub Repository # After logging in, click the top right corner to open the drop-down menu, then click on \u0026ldquo;Your repositories\u0026rdquo; to access the page.\nClick on \u0026ldquo;New\u0026rdquo;\nOn the \u0026ldquo;Create a new repository\u0026rdquo; page:\nCreate two new repositories: one named username.github.io to host the public site, where username is your GitHub username. Additionally, create another private repository named my_site_source as a backup. Normally, only one repository is needed, but my_site_source can store the original files for disaster recovery.\nFor example, if your GitHub username is \u0026ldquo;yuzhencode\u0026rdquo;, the repository name will be yuzhencode.github.io.\nWhen initializing the repository, check the option Initialize this repository with a README to facilitate code pushes later.\n2. Generate Hugo Static Website Locally # Ensure that your hugo.toml or configuration file has the correct baseURL, for example: baseURL = \u0026#34;https://username.github.io/\u0026#34; # Replace username with your GitHub username. Generate static files: Open your blog project directory and run the following command to generate the static files: $hugo The generated static files will be located in the public/ folder of your project. 3. Upload the Generated Files to GitHub Repository # Initialize Git: If your project doesn\u0026rsquo;t already have a Git repository, enter your project root directory and run: $git init Add GitHub Repository as Remote: Add the GitHub repository as a remote origin: $git remote add origin https://github.com/yuzhencode/yuzhencode.github.io.git # Link the local directory to the remote repository. Add the public/ Directory to Git: Enter the public/ folder where the static files were generated: $cd public Initialize Git and add the files: $git init $git add . $git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit - Hugo static files\u0026#34; Push to GitHub: Push the files from public/ to your GitHub repository: $git branch -M main $git push -u origin main 4. Configure GitHub Pages # Enable GitHub Pages: In the Settings tab of your GitHub project, find Pages in the left-hand menu. Under Source, select the main branch and specify /(root) as the publishing directory. After saving these settings, GitHub will start building and hosting your Hugo blog. Access Your Blog: Once GitHub Pages deployment is complete, you can access your blog at https://your-username.github.io/. 5. Local Updates and Deployment # After making updates in Hugo, regenerate the public/ files and repeat the steps in section 4 to push updates:\n$hugo $cd public $git add . $git commit -m \u0026#34;Update site\u0026#34; $git push -u origin main This keeps your Hugo static website synchronized and successfully deployed on GitHub Pages. # 6. Disaster Recovery Backup # For disaster recovery, follow similar commands as in section 3, but do this in the my_site_source directory.\nInitialize Git: Run: $git init Add GitHub Repository as Remote: $git remote add origin https://github.com/yuzhencode/yuzhenblog-source.git # Link the local directory to the remote repository. Add files and push to the GitHub repository: $git add . $git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit - Hugo source files\u0026#34; $git push -u origin main Afterward, regularly update the repository with: $git add . $git commit -m \u0026#34;Update site\u0026#34; $git push -u origin main This document explains how to set up a Hugo-generated blog and deploy it on GitHub Pages, with provisions for both production hosting and disaster recovery backups.\n","date":"23 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tech/publishing_with_github_pages/","section":"TECHNOLOGY","summary":"We aim to host the static website generated by Hugo using GitHub Pages service, which allows us to avoid maintaining our own server and ensures more stability and security.

Site Configuration # After copying the exampleSite folder, the site directory structure becomes as follows: my-site/ ├── archetypes/ │ └── default.md ├── assets/ # Stores files processed by Hugo Pipes ├── config/ # Stores config files by Blowfish ├── content/ # Stores markdown files as blog content ├── data/ # Stores data processed by Hugo ├── i18n/ ├── layouts/ # Stores layout files ├── static/ # Stores static files like images, CSS, and JS files ├── themes/ # Stores different themes └── hugo.toml \u0026lt;\u0026ndash; site configuration Site configuration # Compared to before, the config folder is added, which contains default configuration files:\nconfig/_default/ ├─ hugo.toml ├─ languages.en.toml ├─ markup.toml ├─ menus.en.toml ├─ module.toml └─ params.toml The site configuration is managed through the config/_default/hugo.toml file. The table below outlines all the settings that the Blowfish takes advantage of.\nNote that the variable names provided in this table use dot notation to simplify the TOML data structure (ie. outputs.home refers to [outputs] home).\nName Default Description My Value theme \u0026ldquo;blowfish\u0026rdquo; When using Hugo Modules this config value should be removed. For all other installation types, this must be set to blowfish for the theme to function. baseURL Not set The URL to the root of the website. https://yuzhencode.github.io/ To make Blowfish more flexible, each site needs to create at least one language configuration file. By default, Blowfish provides an config/_default/languages.en.toml file for English support.\nGlobal# # Name Default Description My Value title \u0026ldquo;Blowfish\u0026rdquo; The title of the website. This will be displayed in the site header and footer. Yuzhen Blog Params# # Name Default Description My Value params.logo Not set The relative path to the site logo file within the assets/ folder. The logo file should be provided at 2x resolution and supports any image dimensions. img/your site logo.png params.description Not set The website description. This will be used in the site metadata. Author# # Name Default Description My Value params.author.name Not set The author’s name. This will be displayed in article footers, and on the homepage when the profile layout is used. Yuzhen params.author.image Not set Path to the image file of the author. The image should be a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image can be placed in the site’s assets/ folder or can be external url. img/author picture.jpeg params.author.bio Not set A Markdown string containing the author’s bio. It will be displayed in article footers. customisation params.author.links Not set The links to display alongside the author’s details. The config file contains example links which can simply be uncommented to enable. The order that the links are displayed is determined by the order they appear in the array. Custom links can be added by providing corresponding SVG icon assets in assets/icons/. customisation For more details, refer to the Blowfish official documentation.\n2. Generate Favicons for Multiple Browsers and Platforms at Once # Each platform has different icon design requirements, so the same image cannot be used everywhere. First, select your own icon image and then use the RealFaviconGenerator website to generate icons for different platforms.\nYou may need icons in the following formats:\napple-touch-icon.png (180x180) favicon-32x32.png (32x32) favicon-16x16.png (16x16) mstile-150x150.png (150x150) android-chrome-192x192.png (192x192) android-chrome-512x512.png (512x512) favicon.ico browserconfig.xml site.webmanifest Place the generated images and code in the /static directory of your blog\u0026rsquo;s root directory. You can preview the effect locally using hugo server. After deploying to GitHub Pages, it may take some time to take effect. 3. Setting up Menus # Blowfish provides two menus: the main menu is displayed in the site header, and the footer menu is displayed at the bottom of the page. The configuration files are located in menus.en.toml, and if using multilingual features, the file should be renamed according to the corresponding language code.\nExample configuration: # # config/_default/menus.toml [[main]] name = \u0026#34;ABOUT ME\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;docs/about-me\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;PROJECTS\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;POSTS\u0026#34; weight = 30 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;TECH\u0026#34; parent = \u0026#34;POSTS\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;tech\u0026#34; weight = 40 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;LIFE\u0026#34; parent = \u0026#34;POSTS\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;life\u0026#34; weight = 50 [[main]] identifier = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/yuzhencode\u0026#34; weight = 400 [[footer]] name = \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[footer]] name = \u0026#34;Authors\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;authors\u0026#34; weight = 20 4. Theme Parameters # Blowfish offers a variety of parameters to control the theme\u0026rsquo;s features. These parameters are located in the config/_default/params.toml file.\nGlobal # Name Default Description colorScheme \u0026quot;blowfish\u0026quot; The theme colour scheme to use. Valid values are blowfish (default), avocado, fire, ocean, forest, princess, neon, bloody, terminal, marvel, noir, autumn, congo, andslate. Refer to the Colour Schemes section for more details. defaultAppearance \u0026quot;light\u0026quot; The default theme appearance, either light or dark. enableSearch false Whether site search is enabled.

I want to document this journey. Since all the previous blog files were on an old computer in China and the GitHub repository only had public content, I decided to restart my blog as a way to practice writing and keep records.\nTo avoid falling into the same trap again, this time I want a solution that meets the following requirements:\nSupports markdown and ensures easy migration in the future Allows for service hosting Full control over source files and site files The framework must have strong community support No data loss due to switching computers The Hugo + GitHub Pages solution better meets my needs, and I will continue to deploy using Notion + GitHub Actions in the future.\nLocal Setup # Let\u0026rsquo;s start the journey with Hugo. The official documentation is very detailed, and the following is just a personal record.\n1. Hugo Environment # The installation is very simple. I’m using macOS with Homebrew.\n# Open Terminal $brew install hugo Once complete, you can verify the installation with the following command:\n$hugo version 2. Git Environment # The installation is equally simple.\n$brew install git # Similarly, verify the installation with the following command $git version 3. Create a Site # To create a new web site, you can execute the following command:\n$hugo new site my-site # replace \u0026#39;my-site\u0026#39; with your custom blog name, e.g., YuzhenBlog Hugo will generate a custom site in the current directory.\nAt this point, the site has been created.\nThe structure is as follows: my-site/ ├── archetypes/ │ └── default.md ├── assets/ # Stores files processed by Hugo Pipes ├── content/ # Stores markdown files as blog content ├── data/ # Stores data processed by Hugo ├── i18n/ ├── layouts/ # Stores layout files ├── static/ # Stores static files like images, CSS, and JS files ├── themes/ # Stores different themes └── hugo.toml \u0026lt;\u0026ndash; site configuration For detailed explanation, please refer to Directory structure\n4. Configuring the Blowfish Theme # Refer to the theme documentation\n4.1 Download the Blowfish Theme\nThere are several ways to install the Blowfish theme in your Hugo site.\nManual File Copy Install Using Git Submodule (Recommended) If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure which one to choose, go with the Git submodule method. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the manual method that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a Git environment locally.\nManual File Copy\nDownload the latest theme source code. Download from GitHub Unzip it, rename the folder to blowfish, and move it to the themes/ directory under your Hugo project root. Then modify hugo.toml Install Using Git Submodule\nThis method ensures that the theme is installed and updated simply and quickly. Besides Hugo, you also need to ensure that Git is installed on your local machine.\nNavigate to the site directory you just created my-site, initialize a new git repository, and add Blowfish as a submodule.\n$cd my-site $git init $git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish Then modify hugo.toml\nInstall Using Hugo Module This is not covered in this article, but you can refer to the link for more information. 4.2 Next, add theme = \u0026quot;blowfish\u0026quot; in the hugo.toml file. Then start the service as follows\n$hugo server # Start the service and follow the prompt to open the site preview At this point, the Blowfish theme has been successfully configured.\n4.3 exampleSite\nYou might wonder why the page looks different from the theme. That\u0026rsquo;s because other background images, site logos, styles, and content have not yet been added. The simplest way to get started is to copy all files from my-site/themes/blowfish/exampleSite to the site root directory, which is my-site/. Restart the service to get the following preview, and you can start your customization journey.\nreference\nHugo Documentation https://gohugo.io/documentation/\nBlowfish https://blowfish.page/\n","date":"27 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tech/hugo_blog_setup/","section":"TECHNOLOGY","summary":"Why Rebuild # Recently, I’ve been preparing for the AWS SAA exam and learning new technologies through side projects.
