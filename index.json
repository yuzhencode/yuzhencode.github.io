Since all the previous blog files were on an old computer in China and the GitHub repository only had public content, I decided to restart my blog as a way to practice writing and keep records.\nTo avoid falling into the same trap again, this time I want a solution that meets the following requirements:\nSupports markdown and ensures easy migration in the future Allows for service hosting Full control over source files and site files The framework must have strong community support No data loss due to switching computers The Hugo + GitHub Pages solution better meets my needs, and I will continue to deploy using Notion + GitHub Actions in the future.\nLocal Setup # Let\u0026rsquo;s start the journey with Hugo. The official documentation is very detailed, and the following is just a personal record.\n1. Hugo Environment # The installation is very simple. I’m using macOS with Homebrew.\n# Open Terminal $brew install hugo Once complete, you can verify the installation with the following command:\n$hugo version 2. Git Environment # The installation is equally simple.\n$brew install git # Similarly, verify the installation with the following command $git version 3. Create a Site # To create a new web site, you can execute the following command:\n$hugo new site my-site # replace \u0026#39;my-site\u0026#39; with your custom blog name, e.g., YuzhenBlog Hugo will generate a custom site in the current directory.\nAt this point, the site has been created.\nThe structure is as follows: my-site/ ├── archetypes/ │ └── default.md ├── assets/ # Stores files processed by Hugo Pipes ├── content/ # Stores markdown files as blog content ├── data/ # Stores data processed by Hugo ├── i18n/ ├── layouts/ # Stores layout files ├── static/ # Stores static files like images, CSS, and JS files ├── themes/ # Stores different themes └── hugo.toml \u0026lt;\u0026ndash; site configuration For detailed explanation, please refer to Directory structure\n4. Configuring the Blowfish Theme # Refer to the theme documentation\n4.1 Download the Blowfish Theme\nThere are several ways to install the Blowfish theme in your Hugo site.\nManual File Copy Install Using Git Submodule (Recommended) If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure which one to choose, go with the Git submodule method. Let\u0026rsquo;s start with the manual method that doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a Git environment locally.\nManual File Copy\nDownload the latest theme source code. Download from GitHub Unzip it, rename the folder to blowfish, and move it to the themes/ directory under your Hugo project root. Then modify hugo.toml Install Using Git Submodule\nThis method ensures that the theme is installed and updated simply and quickly. Besides Hugo, you also need to ensure that Git is installed on your local machine.\nNavigate to the site directory you just created my-site, initialize a new git repository, and add Blowfish as a submodule.\n$cd my-site $git init $git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish Then modify hugo.toml\nInstall Using Hugo Module This is not covered in this article, but you can refer to the link for more information. 4.2 Next, add theme = \u0026quot;blowfish\u0026quot; in the hugo.toml file. Then start the service as follows\n$hugo server # Start the service and follow the prompt to open the site preview At this point, the Blowfish theme has been successfully configured.\n4.3 exampleSite\nYou might wonder why the page looks different from the theme. That\u0026rsquo;s because other background images, site logos, styles, and content have not yet been added. The simplest way to get started is to copy all files from my-site/themes/blowfish/exampleSite to the site root directory, which is my-site/. Restart the service to get the following preview, and you can start your customization journey.\nreference\nHugo Documentation https://gohugo.io/documentation/\nBlowfish https://blowfish.page/\n","date":"27 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tech/install-hugo-git/","section":"TECHNOLOGY","summary":"Why Rebuild # Recently, I’ve been preparing for the AWS SAA exam and learning new technologies through side projects.

The table below outlines all the settings that the Blowfish takes advantage of.\nNote that the variable names provided in this table use dot notation to simplify the TOML data structure (ie. outputs.home refers to [outputs] home).\nName Default Description My Value theme \u0026ldquo;blowfish\u0026rdquo; When using Hugo Modules this config value should be removed. For all other installation types, this must be set to blowfish for the theme to function. baseURL Not set The URL to the root of the website. https://yuzhencode.github.io/ To make Blowfish more flexible, each site needs to create at least one language configuration file. By default, Blowfish provides an config/_default/languages.en.toml file for English support.\nGlobal# # Name Default Description My Value title \u0026ldquo;Blowfish\u0026rdquo; The title of the website. This will be displayed in the site header and footer. Yuzhen Blog Params# # Name Default Description My Value params.logo Not set The relative path to the site logo file within the assets/ folder. The logo file should be provided at 2x resolution and supports any image dimensions. img/your site logo.png params.description Not set The website description. This will be used in the site metadata. Author# # Name Default Description My Value params.author.name Not set The author’s name. This will be displayed in article footers, and on the homepage when the profile layout is used. Yuzhen params.author.image Not set Path to the image file of the author. The image should be a 1:1 aspect ratio. The image can be placed in the site’s assets/ folder or can be external url. img/author picture.jpeg params.author.bio Not set A Markdown string containing the author’s bio. It will be displayed in article footers. customisation params.author.links Not set The links to display alongside the author’s details. The config file contains example links which can simply be uncommented to enable. The order that the links are displayed is determined by the order they appear in the array. Custom links can be added by providing corresponding SVG icon assets in assets/icons/. customisation For more details, refer to the Blowfish official documentation.\n2. Generate Favicons for Multiple Browsers and Platforms at Once # Each platform has different icon design requirements, so the same image cannot be used everywhere. First, select your own icon image and then use the RealFaviconGenerator website to generate icons for different platforms.\nYou may need icons in the following formats:\napple-touch-icon.png (180x180) favicon-32x32.png (32x32) favicon-16x16.png (16x16) mstile-150x150.png (150x150) android-chrome-192x192.png (192x192) android-chrome-512x512.png (512x512) favicon.ico browserconfig.xml site.webmanifest Place the generated images and code in the /static directory of your blog\u0026rsquo;s root directory. You can preview the effect locally using hugo server. After deploying to GitHub Pages, it may take some time to take effect. 3. Setting up Menus # Blowfish provides two menus: the main menu is displayed in the site header, and the footer menu is displayed at the bottom of the page. The configuration files are located in menus.en.toml, and if using multilingual features, the file should be renamed according to the corresponding language code.\nExample configuration: # # config/_default/menus.toml [[main]] name = \u0026#34;ABOUT ME\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;docs/about-me\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;PROJECTS\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;POSTS\u0026#34; weight = 30 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;TECH\u0026#34; parent = \u0026#34;POSTS\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;tech\u0026#34; weight = 40 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;LIFE\u0026#34; parent = \u0026#34;POSTS\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;life\u0026#34; weight = 50 [[main]] identifier = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/yuzhencode\u0026#34; weight = 400 [[footer]] name = \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[footer]] name = \u0026#34;Authors\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;authors\u0026#34; weight = 20 4. Theme Parameters # Blowfish offers a variety of parameters to control the theme\u0026rsquo;s features. These parameters are located in the config/_default/params.toml file.\nGlobal # Name Default Description colorScheme \u0026quot;blowfish\u0026quot; The theme colour scheme to use. Valid values are blowfish (default), avocado, fire, ocean, forest, princess, neon, bloody, terminal, marvel, noir, autumn, congo, andslate.

Upload the Generated Files to GitHub Repository # Initialize Git: Enter the public/ folder where the static files were generated and run: $cd public $git init Add GitHub Repository as Remote: Add the GitHub repository as a remote origin: $git remote add origin https://github.com/yuzhencode/yuzhencode.github.io.git # Link the local directory to the remote repository. Add the content in public/ Directory to Git: $git add . $git commit -m \u0026#34;Initial commit - Hugo static files\u0026#34; Push to GitHub: Push the files from public/ to your GitHub repository: $git branch -M main $git push -u origin main 4. Configure GitHub Pages # Enable GitHub Pages: In the Settings tab of your GitHub project, find Pages in the left-hand menu. Under Source, select the main branch and specify /(root) as the publishing directory. After saving these settings, GitHub will start building and hosting your Hugo blog. Access Your Blog: Once GitHub Pages deployment is complete, you can access your blog at https://your-username.github.io/. 5. Local Updates and Deployment # After making updates in Hugo, regenerate the public/ files and repeat the steps in section 4 to push updates:\n$hugo $cd public $git add . $git commit -m \u0026#34;Update site\u0026#34; $git push -u origin main This keeps your Hugo static website synchronized and successfully deployed on GitHub Pages. # 6.

Recently, I finally purchased a 10-year domain on Tencent Cloud for less than 10 pounds. After searching online for articles about custom domains on GitHub, I found the process to be quite simple and can be completed in just a few steps.\nFirst, Register a Domain # There are many domain registrars available online, such as GoDaddy and Namecheap. Many cloud service providers and CDN providers also offer this service, including AWS, GCP, Tencent Cloud, and Cloudflare. This article will provide a detailed explanation based on Tencent Cloud.\nReal-name Verification\nLog in to https://cloud.tencent.com/, go to Console - Domain Registration - Information Template - New Template, and submit it. The review will be completed in about 10 minutes.\nDomain Registration Purchase\nIn the Console - Domain Registration - Overview, enter your desired domain for inquiry, or select a recommended domain and purchase it according to the prompts. After completing this step, you can check Console - Domain Registration - My Domains to see the domain record.\nNext, Add a CNAME File in the Repository # You can choose either of the following operations to bind your domain:\nOption 1: Directly add a CNAME file and enter the domain you want to bind. The file should contain only the main domain you want to bind, without including http:// and www.\nOption 2: Click on your blog repository, go to Settings, find Custom domain, and add your domain before saving it.\nFinally, Add A Records to Point to GitHub Blog IP Address # Open the terminal and use ping on your GitHub blog address username.github.io to obtain an IP address.\nIn My Domains - DNS Settings, add two A records. The record values should be the IP address obtained from the previous step. Set one host record as “www” and the other as “@”. This way, you can access your blog via both yourblog.com and www.yourblog.com. Please wait for the DNS configuration to take effect, which typically completes within 10 minutes.\nAdditional Tips # HTTPS Configuration: Once the domain is successfully bound, remember to enable HTTPS in the GitHub Pages settings to ensure the security of your site. Regularly Check DNS Records: If you find that your site is inaccessible, you can check the DNS settings to ensure there are no errors. Blog Content Management: Regularly update your blog content to stay active and increase visitor return rates. By following these steps, you can successfully bind your domain to GitHub Pages, enhancing the professionalism and accessibility of your personal blog.

But my latest discovery came in a completely unexpected place – right by the canal, on the outskirts of the city. And what I found there was none other than the legendary fly agaric.\nA Sea of White Mushrooms… and One Special Find # It all started with a walk along the canal. I wasn’t on the lookout for anything in particular, but then I noticed a large cluster of white mushrooms, growing in tight, dense patches. To be honest, they didn’t really grab my attention straight away – they seemed fairly ordinary, and I was about to carry on walking. But then I spotted one group of mushrooms that looked especially photogenic, so I wandered over, camera in hand.\nAs I got closer, that’s when I noticed it. Nestled amongst the more common white mushrooms was something much more striking – a small, vibrant red mushroom with its cap still in a ball-like shape. It was only just beginning to grow, the veil between the cap and the stem still intact. And it was immediately clear to me that this was something special: a fly agaric (or Amanita muscaria, for the more scientifically minded).\nRecognising a Classic # Now, at the time, I didn’t know for certain that this was a fly agaric, but it looked just like the kind of mushroom you imagine when you think of poisonous fungi – the very definition of the ‘dangerous red mushroom’ emoji 🍄. I couldn’t contain my excitement. Here, in this unassuming spot by the canal, I had stumbled upon one of the most iconic fungi in existence!\nWhat’s interesting about the fly agaric is its instantly recognisable appearance. Typically, it has:\nA bright red cap: often with white or yellowish spots that are remnants of its universal veil. A white stem: which is tall and elegant, often with a skirt-like ring around it. White gills underneath the cap, tightly packed together. White spore print: if you happen to take a spore print. However, the mushroom I found was still young, with its red cap in a spherical stage, yet to open fully. It was fascinating to see it at this early point in its life cycle – something I hadn’t expected to witness up close.\n“Red Cap, White Stem”: A Cultural Icon # In the UK (and many other places), the fly agaric is almost a cultural icon. It’s featured in everything from fairy tales to video games, with its bright red cap and white spots giving it an almost mythical status. But what many people don’t realise is that it’s also highly toxic. There’s even a popular saying in China that sums it up perfectly: “红伞伞，白杆杆”, which translates to “red cap, white stem” – it’s a phrase used to describe dangerous mushrooms like the fly agaric.\nThe fly agaric contains toxins such as ibotenic acid and muscimol, which, when ingested, can cause nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and confusion. Although it’s not usually fatal, it’s certainly not something you’d want to snack on! Interestingly, in some cultures, such as certain Siberian tribes, fly agarics were used in spiritual rituals for their psychoactive effects. But here in the UK, it’s best admired from a distance.\nA City-Edge Surprise # What made this find even more special was its location. I never expected to come across something as rare as a fly agaric in such an urban setting. It’s a reminder that nature’s surprises aren’t confined to remote forests – they can pop up even in the most unexpected places, like a quiet canal on the edge of a city.\nWhile the cluster of white mushrooms that originally caught my eye might have been more common, this single, striking fly agaric stole the show. It felt almost like nature had placed it there, just for me to discover.\nSafety First: Mushroom Hunting Tips # Of course, while mushroom hunting is a brilliant way to connect with nature, it’s important to remember that safety comes first. If you’re not 100% sure of what you’ve found, it’s always best to leave it where it is. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:\nDon’t eat anything unless you’re absolutely sure what it is. Many mushrooms look alike, and some deadly species closely resemble edible ones. Use a reliable guide or app to help with identification. Admire without touching. Some mushrooms can cause skin irritation or worse, so it\u0026rsquo;s best to avoid handling them unless you\u0026rsquo;re wearing gloves. Wrapping Up # Discovering this fly agaric by the canal was an absolute thrill – a vivid reminder that nature’s wonders can be found in the most unexpected places. Its red cap and white spots were instantly recognisable, and though I was only seeing it in its early stage of growth, it was no less impressive.\nIf you’ve ever come across a similar natural surprise, whether deep in the woods or right on your doorstep, I’d love to hear about it! After all, you never know what magic might be waiting just around the corner.\n“红伞伞，白杆杆”：A Poisonous Mushroom Song # As mentioned earlier, the fly agaric mushroom is vividly captured in a well-known Chinese children’s rhyme. It serves as both a warning and a darkly humorous take on the dangers of eating brightly coloured, unknown mushrooms. Here’s the full version of the rhyme, along with an English translation:\n中文原文： English Translation: 红伞伞，白杆杆 Red cap, white stem 吃完一起躺板板 After eating, you’ll all lie flat 躺板板，埋山山 Lie flat, buried in the hill 亲朋都来吃饭饭 Friends and family come for a meal 饭饭里有红伞伞 In the meal, there\u0026#39;s a red cap 吃完全村都埋山山 Eat it, and the whole village is buried in the hill 来年长满红伞伞 Next year, the hill will be full of red caps ","date":"6 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/life/fungi_05oct2024/","section":"Life","summary":"🍄Fungus found on 05 Oct 2024 # As someone who loves hunting for mushrooms in the wild, I’ve always assumed that","title":"🍄An Unexpected Find: Discovering a Fly Agaric by the Canal","type":"life"},{"content":"","date":"6 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/life/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Life","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"6 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/life/","section":"Life","summary":"","title":"Life","type":"life"},{"content":"","date":"6 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mushroom/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mushroom","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-10-06","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/tags/%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB/","section":"标签","summary":"","title":"生活","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2024-10-06","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/zh-cn/tags/%E8%98%91%E8%8F%87/","section":"标签","summary":"","title":"蘑菇","type":"tags"},{"content":" 1.
